# HERE IN PARADISE:

Nobody knows who I am.

There are four "I"s in "identity politics," and none of them are me. From conservative to communist, I believe in free speech. I believe in listening. In keeping friends on all sides of all aisles. In compassion, even for the stupid.

The calendar reads January 27, 2021. Three weeks after the "insurrection" in the United States. Protesters descended on government buildings in D.C. and became rioters — breaking into the Senate, and making a mockery of any "security" presence at our most important governing buildings. 

It was a surreal, scary sight to see.

But more scary, and more long-term: the broad daylight suppression of speech.

In light of the riots in D.C., the President was banned both from Twitter and Facebook simultaneously — the former of which he may never again have an account on. Conservatives flocked to alternative social networks like Parler, only to have Amazon jump in to take the site down. (Parler was running on AWS, Amazon Web Services.)

These actions were only cherries on top of a disturbing curation of the very thoughts of people.

Not users. Not accounts.

People.

"Fact-checking" and "content warnings" abound on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook — all with the purpose of confirming one view and discrediting the other. These attempts at influencing the opinions of people are so ubiquitous, they are mocked daily. Real-life people have been fired from real-life jobs for creating accounts on Parler or Gab (another alternative social network). How dare they participate, for whatever reasons, in discourse that doesn't fit one narrative? "Cancel culture" abounds. 

Only ten years ago there were still debates on who had the better ideas. Now, there are debates on what your punishment should be for questioning.

Incitement of violence is not free speech. But (almost) everything else *is.* 

My friends consist both of conservatives and communists, anarchists and anti-vaxxers. They are all intelligent, free-thinking people, and I value them all as people — not for their opinions. None deserve to be cast aside for their thoughts on various issues.

Yet this is the world we live in:

One where I would never express these opinions under my real name. One where this short writing can be framed as love for insurrectionists, or support for conspirators. One where I fear speaking on what I believe, knowing full well I can be cast aside quicker than one can close a browser tab.

Here in paradise, nobody knows who I am.

Here in paradise, I don't know who you are.

We only know each other as people, as what we believe, and we have nothing to lose for our discourse. Praise me, disagree with me, vilify, or glorify me — engage in discussion.

This is a call for conversation again.
